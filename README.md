Machine learning with Amazon reviews

This program trains and tests three classification models, in the context of sentiment analysis, on Amazon reviews (provided by https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/amazon_v2/) and measures performance metrics on their ability to predict customer review ratings (from 1 to 5 stars).

The three methods implemented are a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) Natural Language Processing model, a Multilayer Perceptron model, and a Naive Bayes classification model (tests two different classifiers).

Project for Portland State University's CS 545 - Machine Learning course (2023).
